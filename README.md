#### This project is to refactor Dash core (https://github.com/dashpay/dash) in Rust.

#### Why?
- This is an opportunity get an in-depth understanding of how Dash works
- To improve my skill in Rust and lower level programming

#### Why Rust?
Rust's focus is on safety while still running fast, approaching the speed of `C`.  
(https://www.rust-lang.org)

Rust prevents several potential vulnerabilities classed as `segfaults`.  
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault)

#### Stages and goals

To begin I'll work on this project little by little in my spare time to get to a working state.  

##### I will:
- Become acquainted with C++ to start understanding Dash core
  - Also learn about GNU autotools (https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html)
- Gain a big picture view of the source code starting with initialization and figuring out the major parts (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=41718.0)
- Start initial implementation of Rust, organizing code so that it's intuitive easier for other developers learn the codebase
- Research `C` bindings in Rust
- This list will grow as I progress...
